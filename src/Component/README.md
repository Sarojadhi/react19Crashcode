🧩 What is a Component in React?

A component in React is a reusable piece of UI (User Interface).
It’s like a small building block that you can combine to make a complete web page or app.
Each component handles its own structure, style, and logic.

⚙️ How to Use a Component

You can use a component like an HTML tag.

🎯 Role of Component in React

1. Reusability – You can use one component in multiple places.

2. Organization – Breaks UI into smaller, easy-to-manage parts.

3. Maintenance – Each component works independently, so fixing or updating is easy.

4. State Handling – Components can manage their own data using React hooks (like useState).

5. Dynamic UI – React automatically updates only the components that need to change.

⚖️ Difference Between Component and Function :

component :
1. Special function that returns JSX (UI)
2. Returns JSX (UI elements)
3. Must start with Capital Letter (e.g., MyComponent)
4. Used to build UI parts of an app 
5. function Header() { return <h1>Title</h1>; } 

Function : 
1. Normal function that performs logic or calculations
2. Returns data or values
3. Can start with lowercase
4. Used for logic, helpers, or calculations
5. function add(a,b) { return a+b; }

🧠 In short:

A React component is a special function that returns UI (JSX) instead of plain data.
Components make React apps modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
